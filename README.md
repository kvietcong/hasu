# hasu!
A Haskell library made for osu! (Haskell + osu!)

Yeah, I'm pretty sure no one will ever use this but I think it will be nice
to use this as an enjoyable way to learn Haskell.

## Goals
I have some goals for this project that I hope I can fulfill before giving up XD:
- Cover the osu!v1 API
- When the osu!v2 API comes out, implement that
- Have Bancho connection capabilities

## But Actually Why
IDK Lol
